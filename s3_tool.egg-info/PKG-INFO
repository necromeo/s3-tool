Description: # S3 Command Line Utility
        
        ### Credentials
        
        First of all, you will need to have your credentials ready.
        The following are needed (next to them are the names of the environmental variables associated to them):
        
        * Endpoint `ENDPOINT`
        * Access Key `ACCESS_KEY`
        * Secret Access Key `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
        * Bucket `BUCKET`
        * OPTIONALLY: if you have an HTTP prefix for accessing keys over a web browser you can add it with the `HTTP_PREFIX` variable
        
        In order to avoid having to introduce your credentials after every command execution it is possible to store them as environmental variables.
        You can even do this temporarily setting a variables as `export ENDPOINT_URL=MyURL`. This way, your credentials will only be set for the current terminal.
        
        ### Operations
        
        The following operations are possible:
        
        * Listing all keys in a bucket
        * Listing keys according to a prefix in a bucket
        * Change key permissions to public-read
        * Upload any number of keys. Is Multithreaded.
        * Download any number of keys. Is Multithreaded.
